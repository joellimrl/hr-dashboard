### Prerequisites

Expo CLI
We use expo for building the application. Please install the Expo App on your physical test device as well.

To test notifications, please open the app using the Expo app at least once. Once that is done, anytime someone registers a new Employee with your backend server, you will get a notification.

Styling is all done in the same file
